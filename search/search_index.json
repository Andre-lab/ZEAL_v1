This is done by projecting the shape onto a 3D basis set of Zernike-Canterakis functions up to a specific order; the higher the order, the higher is the level of detail captured by the moments associated with each member of the set. ZEAL will find the optimalshape alignment by searching for the rotation that maximizes the correlation of these moments. Installation \u00b6 Download the ZEAL installer from github.com/Andre-lab/ZEAL . The installer will download the MATLAB-runtime enviroment necessary for ZEAL to run. To install the standalone application, double-click the ZEALinstaller_web.app executable. If you want to connect to the Internet using a proxy server, click Connection Settings. Enter the proxy server settings in the provided window. Click OK. To complete installation, follow the instructions on the user interface. Note On Linux and Mac OS X, you do not have the option of adding a desktop shortcut. Installing ZEAL as a MatlabApp \u00b6 If you have MATLAB installed, you can install ZEAL as a Matlab app directly. Download the mlapp-installer file \u00b4ZEAL.mlappinstall\u00b4 at github.com/Andre-lab/ZEAL/ Double-click the \u00b4ZEAL.mlappinstall\u00b4 and ZEAL will be installed as an app within MATLAB. Launching the app \u00b6 To run your standalone application: Open a terminal window. Windows 1. Click the \"Start\" button to open the Start menu. 2. Open the \"All Programs\" menu, followed by the \"Accessories\" option. 3. Select the \"Command Prompt\" option from the \"Accessories\" menu. Mac OS X 1. Open a Finder window. 2. Select Applications from the left side. 3. Click the arrow to expand the Utilities folder. 4. Double-click Terminal. Navigate to the folder into which you installed the application. If you accepted the default settings, you can find the folder in one of the following locations by executing the command in the terminal: Platform Path Windows cd C:\\Program Files\\ZEAL Mac OS X cd /Applications/ZEAL Linux cd /usr/ZEAL Run the application using one of the following commands: Platform Path Windows application\\ZEAL Mac OS X ./application/run_ZEAL.sh /Applications/MATLAB/MATLAB_Runtime/v97 Linux ./ZEAL Mac OS X - The shell script `run_ZEAL.sh` will temporarily set the necessary environment variables and start the application) - to run the shell script, type ./run_ZEAL.sh <mcr_directory> <argument_list> at Linux or Mac command prompt. `<mcr_directory>` is the directory where version 9.7 of the MATLAB Runtime is installed or the directory where MATLAB is installed on the machine. For example, if you have version 9.7 of the MATLAB Runtime installed in /mathworks/home/application/v97, run the shell script as: ./run_ZEAL.sh /mathworks/home/application/v97 If you have MATLAB installed in /mathworks/devel/application/matlab, run the shell script as: ./run_ZEAL.sh /mathworks/devel/application/matlab Getting started \u00b6","title":"Home"},{"location":"#shape-based-molecular-alignment","text":"","title":"Shape-based molecular alignment"},{"location":"#overview","text":"ZEAL is an app that allows two molecules to be aligned based on their shape resemblance alone.
